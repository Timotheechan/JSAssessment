  What did you like about this project?
  Its challenging. It accesses my coding skills and understand. I felt I understand the logic better than before this assessment.

  The syntax. Intially I could not translate my logic into the computer syntax and it took me quite awhile to figure it out.
  Which in a good way, I learnt alot from this.
  
  What would make your experience with this assessment better?
  I think have a few more hints could have made my life easier but than I wouldnt have learn as much as now.
